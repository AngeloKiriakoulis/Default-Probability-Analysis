# Default Probability Analysis

This project analyzes client financial data to predict the probability of default payments for credit card holders. Using demographic information and credit history, the analysis aims to model default risk effectively.

## Features
The dataset includes:
- **Demographic Data**: Gender, age, marital status.
- **Credit History**: Payment delays, credit amount, and past payments.
- **Target Variable**: Probability of default payment next month.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distribution and relationships.
- **Modeling**: Building predictive models to estimate default probability.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics and visualizations.
